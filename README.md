Bindings generator for JNI libraries for the Rust programming language!!!

This a fork is based on `jni-bindgen`. The difference betweent this project and upstream is because this fork uses [Robusta](https://github.com/waylovely-project/robusta) and the [jni-rs](https://github.com/waylovely-project/jni-rs/) crate, unlike upstream which uses its own solution!!
